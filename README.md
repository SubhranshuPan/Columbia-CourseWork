## ü§ñ Machine Learning I

[cite_start]This course provided a comprehensive foundation in supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, guided by Dr. John Paisley, an expert in probabilistic modeling and data analysis. [cite: 2] The curriculum focused on the mathematical principles behind core ML models and their practical application.

### Skills & Knowledge

* **Supervised Learning**: Linear Regression and Classification 
* **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction 
* **Mathematical Foundations**: A deep understanding of the math underpinning ML techniques, including maximum likelihood estimation.
* **Practical Application**: Data analysis, manipulation, and implementing solutions through coding projects. 

### üìÇ Course Projects

* **Project 1: Linear & Polynomial Regression**
    * *Description*: A project exploring regression models to predict outcomes based on input data.
    
* **Project 2: Classification Algorithms**
    * *Description*: Implemented and compared different classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) on a real-world dataset.
    
* **Project 3: Unsupervised Learning**
    * *Description*: Applied clustering (e.g., K-Means) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) techniques to uncover patterns in data.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Prompt Engineering & Programming with OpenAI

Taught by Hardeep Johar, this course offered hands-on experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI.  The focus was on practical techniques for building AI-powered features using the OpenAI API, LangChain, and LlamaIndex. 

### Skills & Knowledge

**Core AI Skills**: Prompt Engineering (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot), Python Programming for LLM Workflows, and Generative AI.
**API & Tooling**: Programmatic access to the OpenAI API and using libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex to build applications.
**Practical Outputs**: Generating diverse outputs including text, images, and audio, and automating business tasks.

### üìÇ Course Projects

* **Project 1: Advanced Prompting Techniques**
    * *Description*: A collection of prompts designed to generate specific outputs like formatted emails, SQL queries, and complex summaries.
    
* **Project 2: AI Application with OpenAI API**
    * *Description*: A Python application that uses the OpenAI API to automate a business process or assist with data analytics.
    
* **Project 3: Data Analysis with LangChain/LlamaIndex**
    * *Description*: A project leveraging LangChain and/or LlamaIndex to analyze documents and generate insights.
