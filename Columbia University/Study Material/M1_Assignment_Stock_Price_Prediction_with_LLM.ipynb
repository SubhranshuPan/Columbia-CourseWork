Instead of manually writing code, we will interact with Google's Gemini (Click on the Gemini icon on the top right corner) in Google Colab to:\n","\n","- Load and analyze stock price data.\n","- Engineer relevant features for prediction.\n","- Build and evaluate models such as regression and random forest.\n","- Discuss potential trading strategies based on predictions.\n","\n","**Note**: While this notebook contains example code, students are encouraged to use LLMs to generate code snippets and explanations, managing interactions within the LLM's context window.\n","\n","## Task Breakdown\n","\n","### Step 1: Data Exploration\n","- **Prompt the LLM**: Load historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-01-01 using Yahoo Finance.\n","- **Key Considerations**: Ensure the model retains context while summarizing key statistics.\n","\n","### Step 2: Feature Engineering\n","- **Prompt the LLM**: Generate meaningful features such as moving averages, technical indicators, and volatility measures.\n","- **Managing Context**: If the LLM forgets prior outputs, remind it by reintroducing key statistics.\n","\n","### Step 3: Model Building\n","- **Prompt the LLM**: Train a model (regression for price prediction, random forest for trend classification).\n","- **Split Ratio Consideration**: Explain the importance of train-test split (e.g., 70/30) and verify the LLM respects it.\n","\n","### Step 4: Model Evaluation & Prediction\n","- **Prompt the LLM**: Use the trained model to predict stock prices for 2023-2024.\n","- **Analyze Performance**: Interpret accuracy, R² scores, and classification reports.\n","\n","### Step 5: Strategy Discussion\n","- **Prompt the LLM**: Based on model performance, discuss possible trading strategies.\n","- **Critical Thinking**: Evaluate whether the model is truly useful for financial decision-making.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Throughout the assignment, keep in mind that LLMs have a limited context window. If necessary, break down tasks into smaller chunks and reintroduce critical information.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1_csYjq8h7yt"},"source":["## Using Gemini in Colab\n","\n","To use Gemini directly in your browser within Google Colab:\n","\n","1. **Create a new code cell** by clicking the `+ Code` button.\n","2.

Conversely, if a significant decrease is predicted, one might consider selling or shorting the stock.\n","\n","# 2.  **Trading Around the Predicted Price:** Instead of a simple buy/sell based on the direction, one could use the predicted price as a target. If the current price is significantly below the predicted price, buy with the expectation it will move towards the prediction. If it's above, sell with the expectation it will move down.\n","\n","# 3.  **Using Predictions in Conjunction with Technical Indicators:** The predicted price could be used as another input or confirmation signal for existing trading strategies based on moving averages, RSI, or volatility. For example, only buy if the model predicts an increase AND the stock is above its 50-day moving average.\n","\n","# 4.  **Threshold-Based Trading:** Define a threshold for the predicted price change (e.g., predict a 1% increase). Only execute a trade if the predicted change exceeds this threshold to avoid trading on minor, potentially noisy predictions.\n","\n","# **Critical Thinking: Evaluating the Model's Usefulness for Financial Decision-Making**\n","\n","# Based on the output of this simple linear regression model, it's highly unlikely to be truly useful for financial decision-making and profitable trading for several reasons:\n","\n","# 1.  **Model Simplicity:** A linear regression model is too simplistic to capture the complex, non-linear dynamics of the stock market. Stock prices are influenced by a vast array of factors beyond the technical indicators used here, including macroeconomic news, company-specific events, market sentiment, and unpredictable global events.\n","# 2.  **Low R-squared (Likely):** While the R-squared score is not printed in the final output of the provided code block, for a simple linear regression model predicting tomorrow's stock price, the R-squared value is often quite low. A low R-squared means the model explains only a small portion of the variance in the stock price, indicating that many other factors are influencing the price movements.\n","# 3.  **Look-Ahead Bias Risk:** While the code attempts to predict \"Tomorrow_Close\", if any of the engineered features (like moving averages or RSI) for a given day unknowingly incorporate data from future days *relative to the prediction point for that day*, it would introduce look-ahead bias, making the model appear better than it is on historical data but fail in real-world predictions. The way the features are calculated here (`.rolling()` and `.ewm()` on the historical `data` *before* the train-test split and before calculating `Tomorrow_Close`) seems appropriate, but it's a critical point to verify when building such models.\n","# 4.  **Transaction Costs:** Even if the model had some predictive power, transaction costs (brokerage fees, spreads) can quickly erode any small profits generated by frequent trading based on daily predictions.\n","# 5.  **Market Efficiency:** The efficient market hypothesis suggests that current stock prices already reflect all available information. Consistently predicting future prices using publicly available historical data and simple technical indicators is extremely difficult.\n","# 6.  **Overfitting Risk:** Without proper cross-validation or considering a longer time horizon for the test set, there's a risk that the model might perform reasonably well on the specific 2023 data downloaded but fail on truly unseen future data.\n","# 7.  **Lack of Risk Management:** The discussion of strategies doesn't include any form of risk management (e.g., stop-loss orders, position sizing), which is crucial for any real trading strategy.\n","\n","# In conclusion, while the linear regression model provides an example of how to approach stock price prediction, its simplicity and the inherent unpredictability\n","# of the stock market make it insufficient for real-world financial decision-making.\n","# It serves as a foundational exercise, highlighting the need for more sophisticated models, a wider range of features (including fundamental and alternative data),\n","# robust validation techniques, and rigorous risk management for any potentially viable trading strategy."],"metadata":{"id":"q0uU1zt-GYXr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KSb-lVTs67ir"},"source":["# Sample Prompts and LLM Responses\n","---\n","\n","## Step 1: Data Exploration\n","\n","### Prompt:\n","> Load historical stock price data for Apple Inc.

However, the precision and recall metrics indicate that while the model is good at identifying days when the stock price does not increase (class 0), it struggles significantly to identify days when the stock price does increase (class 1). This suggests a need for further feature engineering or model tuning to improve the prediction performance for this specific classification task.\n","- Potential Trading Strategies\n","Given the model's performance, potential trading strategies could be formulated as follows:\n","\n","#### Conservative Strategy:\n","\n","- **Focus**: Only trade on days when the model predicts a price increase with high confidence.\n","- **Action**: Buy stocks when the model predicts an increase (class 1).\n","- **Risk Management**: Since the model has a high precision for the no-increase class (class 0), it might be more reliable to stay out of the market when the model predicts no increase.\n","\n","#### Contrarian Strategy:\n","\n","- **Focus**: Take advantage of the model's high recall for no price increase predictions (class 0).\n","- **Action**: Sell short or avoid buying stocks on days when the model predicts no increase.\n","- **Risk Management**: This strategy assumes that the model’s predictions of no price increase are more reliable. It requires a careful assessment of market conditions to avoid false signals.\n","\n","#### Hybrid Strategy:\n","\n","- **Combine**: Use both conservative and contrarian strategies based on confidence thresholds.\n","- **Action**: Set a higher threshold for buying (only buy when the predicted probability of price increase is significantly high) and a lower threshold for selling or staying out of the market.\n","- **Risk Management**: Adjust thresholds dynamically based on recent model performance and market volatility.\n","\n","\n","---\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","Through this assignment, we have explored how LLMs can assist in complex machine learning tasks without requiring extensive coding knowledge. Key takeaways:\n","\n","- **Context Management**: LLMs have limited memory, so breaking tasks into smaller steps and reinforcing context is crucial.\n","- **Feature Engineering with LLMs**: The model can suggest features but needs guidance on financial relevance.\n","- **Modeling with LLMs**: LLMs can write and refine code, but human judgment is necessary to validate results.\n","- **Real-world Limitations**: Stock price prediction remains challenging; models should be used critically and not solely relied upon for trading decisions.\n","\n","Next Steps:\n","- Experiment with different LLMs and compare outputs.\n","- Try refining feature engineering techniques.\n","- Test alternative modeling approaches, such as deep learning or ensemble methods.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"uTn1hOV8Dxfk"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/ColumbiaPlus/Prompt-Engineering-And-Programming-With-OpenAI/blob/main/M1_Assignment_Stock_Price_Prediction_with_LLM.ipynb","timestamp":1752146338929}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
